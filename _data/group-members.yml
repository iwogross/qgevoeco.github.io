  - name: Iwo Gross
    role: Ph.D. Student
    start-date: 2017
    bio: >
        Iwo’s baccalaureate and master’s work investigated the space-use patterns of diminutive snake species and newborn pit-vipers with respect to road ecology and forest management practices. As a Ph.D. student, Iwo intends to expand his research scope to assess how natural, sexual, and anthropogenic pressures within an ecosystem shape turtle demographics and life-history evolution. In his free time, Iwo practices jiu-jitsu and judo, and enjoys recreational surveys for amphibians and reptiles.

    bio: >
        I am interested in the ecology, evolution, and biogeography of reptiles and amphibians – especially turtles. For my thesis I am studying stripe-necked musk turtles (Sternotherus peltifer) in the Cahaba river. When not chasing down turtles, I enjoy hiking, photography, and SCUBA diving.
